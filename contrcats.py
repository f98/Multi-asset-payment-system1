# smart contract logic ---> whenver  a buyer agrees on a transaction a smart contrcat does the following :
#1 checks if  the buyer has assets to pay with in the first place
#2 checks what is the seller's time prefrence ( when does he want to recieve all of his money )
# 3 from the list of stragies pick the startegies that reaches the nash equilibrium 
#4 based on the nash equilibrium choes the payment package is tranfered to the sellers address
# 5 during the  time frame window the AI agent sells the asset to expected maximum price 

    # create the app 
    
    
    # import assets 
    
    
    # update the prices 
    
    
    
    # nash equilibrium
